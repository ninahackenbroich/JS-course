// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
